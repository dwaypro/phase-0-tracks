# Git Definitions

**Instructions: ** Define each of the following Git concepts.

* What is version control?  Why is it useful?
  version control is software used to protect the integrity of a project before it goes into production. This is usefull because it introduces the opportunity to review code before it affects the master file. 

* What is a branch and why would you use one?
  a branch is an instance of a previous branch, or master branch, that can be worked on without affecting said branch. You would use it in order to protect the integrity of the previous branch, or master branch, before commiting any changes. 
  
* What is a commit? What makes a good commit message?
  a commit is the next step in the submission process after files have been added to a repositiory. a good commit message includes a brief but accurate overview of the changes that have been made. 

* What is a merge conflict?
  merge conflics in git are simply situations caused by users that git cannot resolve on its own. For example if a user deletes a line while another modifies, git will not know what the correct action is.
